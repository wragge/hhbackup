# RecordSearch

Jupyter notebooks to work with data from the National Archives of Australia's RecordSearch database.

[RecordSearch](https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/) is the online collection database of the National Archives of Australia. Based on the [series system](http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/fact-sheets/fs06.aspx), RecordSearch provides rich, contextual information about series, items, agencies, and functions.

Unfortunately RecordSearch doesn't provide access to machine-readable data through an API, so we have to resort to screen scraping. The notebooks here all make use of the [RecordSearch Tools library](https://github.com/wragge/recordsearch_tools) to handle the scraping.

Run the notebooks in this repository live on MyBinder â€” just click the button (it might take a little while to load).

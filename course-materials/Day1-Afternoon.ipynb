    "I've started compiling a [list of GLAM data sources](https://glam-workbench.github.io/glam-data-list/), including APIs, and downloadbale collections of text and images. There's also an associated [list of GLAM datasets](https://glam-workbench.github.io/glam-datasets-from-gov-portals/) that I've harvested from government open data portals – including more than 600 CSV files! There's also a [searchable database of the GLAM datasets](https://ozglam-datasets.glitch.me/data/glam-datasets-from-gov-portals) on Glitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also many notebooks in the GLAM Workbench to help you obtain data – for example by harvesting details of newspaper articles from Trove, screenscraping metadata from the National Archives of Australia, or downloading collection data via the National Museum API. Take some time to explore all the possible data sources, and think about what interests you.\n",

    "#### 1. Some manual CSV exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "The GLAM CSV Explorer works by analysing each column in the dataset – what sorts of values does it contain, what is the range of values, how many are there? Whenever we come across a new source of structured data it can be useful to explore its size and shape.\n",

But while it might not be organised into rows and columns like CSV files, text has it's own structures – words, sentences, names, parts of speech. There are a variety of tools we can use to explore these implicit structures. Let's start with the simplest and count some words.\n",

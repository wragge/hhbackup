    "**QueryPic deconstructed** is a handy app for looking for change over time in the newspaper search results. But if you want to explore the trends it reveals in more depth, you probably want to know a bit more about what it's actually doing – the limitations and possibilities. Fortunately there's a notebook that does just that, showing how you can use search facets to slice and dice the seach results in interesting ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open up [Visualise Trove newspaper searches over time](../trove-newspapers/visualise-searches-over-time.ipynb)\n",

    "### Back to Trove web interface\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Armed with the interesting feature you found while playing around with QueryPic, go to the [Trove web interface](https://trove.nla.gov.au/) and and construct a search that focuses on that feature. For example, you might use the facets to filter your search by year, state, newspaper, or article type. For the purposes of this exercise, you want to limit the number of results in your search to a few thousand. (This is just so you don't spend the rest of the day waiting for your 253,000 newspaper articles to download...)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digging deeper with the Trove Newspaper Harvester\n",
    "\n",
    "The Trove Newspaper Harvester is a command line tool that also dates back about 10 years. I've embedded it in a couple of notebooks in the GLAM Workbench to make it easier to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Newspaper Harvester downloads all the metadata about newspaper articles in a Trove search, and the OCRd text of each individual article. This means that we can explore the contents of the articles in depth with a variety of tools. It's worth remembering too that the Trove web interface only lets you see the first 2,000 articles in your search. The Newspaper Harvester can download many thousands of articles. A while back I harvested more than half a million articles to [explore the changing context of the words 'aliens' and 'immigrants'](http://timsherratt.org/blog/who-belongs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently I added the option to save images of all the newspaper articles. This is pretty cool, but it does slow the harvest down considerably. If you want to try out the image harvesting, start with a search that has a small number of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open up [Using TroveHarvester to get newspaper articles in bulk](../trove-newspaper-harvester/Using-TroveHarvester-to-get-newspaper-articles-in-bulk.ipynb). There's also an app-ified version in the GLAM Workbench, but the notebook includes a bit more information about what's going on.\n",
    "2. Paste in your Trove API key where indicated. Remember to run the cell to save the value!\n",
    "3. Paste the search you copied from the Trove web interface in as the value of `query`. Remember to run the cell to save the value!\n",
    "4. Run the cell that says `%run -m troveharvester -- start $query $api_key --text` to start your harvest.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If you want to get images as well, you need to add ` --image` to this cell before you start harvesting.\n",
    "6. While you're waiting for your harvest to complete, have a read of the information about the format of the harvest results.\n",
    "7. Once your harvest has finished, zip up and download all the the text, data, and images by running the two cells under 'Download your data'. Once it's downloaded, unzip it!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use the CSV Explorer to visualise your results!\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't know if you noticed yesterday, but the GLAM CSV Explorer includes an option to upload your own CSV file for analysis. Let's see what happens when we upload the article metadata we just harvested. Once again we need to generate an appmode link to the CSV Explorer with the following cell."

    "\n",
    "2. [Explore harvested text files](../trove-newspaper-harvester/Explore-harvested-text-files.ipynb) does some word frequency analysis across **all** the files of OCRd text. It's worth having a look at, especially for the cool faceted charts! It also lets you compare the frequency of particular words (like QueryPic, but with bubbles).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Faceted data](../images/faceted-data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally, [Explore harvested text files using TF-IDF](../trove-newspaper-harvester/Explore-harvested-text-files-using-tfidf.ipynb) looks at word frequency a bit differently. TF-IDF scores are calculated by comparing the number of times a word appears in a single document to the number of times it appears in a collection of documents. Word frequencies point us to 'common' words, TF-IDF can indicate 'significant' words. This notebook aggregates the articles by year and then calculates TF-IDF values for each word in each year. How do the words highlighted by TF-IDF differ to the most frequent words?\n"
